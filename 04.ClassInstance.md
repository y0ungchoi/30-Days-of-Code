## Day 04: Class vs. Instance

### Task
Write a Person class with an instance variable, `age`, and a constructor that takes an integer, `initialAge`, as a parameter. The constructor must assign `initialAge` to `0` after confirming the argument passed as `initialAge` is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as `initialAge`, the constructor should set `age` to `0` and print `Age is not valid, setting age to 0.`. In addition, you must write the following instance methods:

1. `yearPasses()` should increase the `age` instance variable by `1`.
2. `amIOld()` should perform the following conditional actions:
   - If `age < 13`, print `You are young.`.
   - If  `age >= 13`and , print `You are a teenager.`.
   - Otherwise, print `You are old.`.

To help you learn by example and complete this challenge, much of the code is provided for you, but you'll be writing everything in the future. The code that creates each instance of your Person class is in the main method. Don't worry if you don't understand it all quite yet!

Note: Do not remove or alter the stub code in the editor.

### Input Format

Input is handled for you by the stub code in the editor.

The first line contains an integer,  (the number of test cases), and the  subsequent lines each contain an integer denoting the  of a Person instance.

### Output Format

Complete the method definitions provided in the editor so they meet the specifications outlined above; the code to test your work is already in the editor. If your methods are implemented correctly, each test case will print 2 or 3 lines (depending on whether or not a valid `initialAge` was passed to the constructor).

### Sample Input
```
4
-1
10
16
18
```
### Sample Output
```
Age is not valid, setting age to 0.
You are young.
You are young.

You are young.
You are a teenager.

You are a teenager.
You are old.

You are old.
You are old.
```

### Solution
```js
process.stdin.resume();
process.stdin.setEncoding('ascii');

var input_stdin = "";
var input_stdin_array = "";
var input_currentline = 0;

process.stdin.on('data', function (data) {
    input_stdin += data;
});

process.stdin.on('end', function () {
    input_stdin_array = input_stdin.split("\n");
    main();    
});

function readLine() {
    return input_stdin_array[input_currentline++];
}

    1. Calling this.amIOld() inside the constructor recursively
    2. The age variable is private to the constrctor scpor

    if (age < 0 ) {
        console.log("Age is not valid, setting age to 0.");
        age = 0;
        this.amIOld();

    var age=parseInt(readLine());
    var p=new Person(age);

        p.yearPasses();
        
    }

### Note
1. Usage of `this` in the function

    | Use Case                             | Should You Use `this`?               |
    | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
    | Defining object properties           | ✅ Yes                                |
    | Accessing or modifying instance data | ✅ Yes                                |
    | Inside methods of an object          | ✅ Yes                                |
    | Inside standalone functions          | ⚠️ Depends on context                |
    | Inside arrow functions               | ⚠️ Arrow functions don't bind `this` |
