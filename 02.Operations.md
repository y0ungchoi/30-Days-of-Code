## Day 2: Operators

### Task
Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer.

### Example

A tip of 15% * 100 = 15, and the taxes are 8% * 100 = 8. Print the value 123 and return from the function.

### Function Description
Complete the solve function in the editor below.

solve has the following parameters:

- int meal_cost: the cost of food before tip and tax
- int tip_percent: the tip percentage
- int tax_percent: the tax percentage
Returns The function returns nothing. Print the calculated value, rounded to the nearest integer.

Note: Be sure to use precise values for your calculations, or you may end up with an incorrectly rounded result.

### Input Format

There are  lines of numeric input:
The first line has a double,  (the cost of the meal before tax and tip).
The second line has an integer,  (the percentage of  being added as tip).
The third line has an integer,  (the percentage of  being added as tax).

#### Sample Input
```
12.00
20
8
```
#### Sample Output
```
15
```

#### Solution
```js
'use strict';

process.stdin.resume();
process.stdin.setEncoding('utf-8');

let inputString = '';
let currentLine = 0;

process.stdin.on('data', function(inputStdin) {
    inputString += inputStdin;
});

process.stdin.on('end', function() {
    inputString = inputString.split('\n');

    main();
});

function readLine() {
    return inputString[currentLine++];
}

/*
 * Complete the 'solve' function below.
 *
 * The function accepts following parameters:
 *  1. DOUBLE meal_cost
 *  2. INTEGER tip_percent
 *  3. INTEGER tax_percent
 */

function solve(meal_cost, tip_percent, tax_percent) {
    // Write your code here
    let total_cost = 0;

    total_cost = meal_cost + (meal_cost*tip_percent)/100 + (meal_cost*tax_percent)/100;
    
    console.log(Math.round(total_cost));
}

function main() {
    const meal_cost = parseFloat(readLine().trim());

    const tip_percent = parseInt(readLine().trim(), 10);

    const tax_percent = parseInt(readLine().trim(), 10);

    solve(meal_cost, tip_percent, tax_percent);
}

```

#### Note
1. Why use `.trim()`?
- .trim() removes leading and trailing whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines).
This ensures that your parseFloat() and parseInt() calls work properly.

    Example:

    ```js
    parseFloat(" 12.00\n")     // might cause issues without trim
    parseFloat(" 12.00\n".trim())  // returns 12.00 correctly
    ```
    Always trimming input from the console is good practice.

2. What’s the opposite of `Math.round()`?

    | Function        | Description            | Example               |
    | --------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
    | `Math.round(x)` | Nearest integer        | `Math.round(2.6)` → 3 |
    | `Math.floor(x)` | Largest integer ≤ `x`  | `Math.floor(2.6)` → 2 |
    | `Math.ceil(x)`  | Smallest integer ≥ `x` | `Math.ceil(2.1)` → 3  |
    | `Math.trunc(x)` | Removes decimal part   | `Math.trunc(2.9)` → 2 |
